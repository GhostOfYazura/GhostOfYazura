### Hello! Thanks for stopping by!
I'm currently looking for work primarily as a DevOps Engineer or Software Engineer with a focus on the former. <br>
I have more experience with Software Directly and I am more than option to those positions.

If you're interested in me, I enjoy a variety of different things. At the moment my focus is on fashion and physical fitness. <br>
In the near future I will be painting minitures again and dancing. ðŸ™‚



If you're interested in my repositories awesome!  ___I license everything that I can under MIT___  so please use the solutions if you need them!
