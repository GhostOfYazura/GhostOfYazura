### Hello! Thanks for stopping by!

I'm Roderick Fitzgerald. I like to joke around and have fun when I can!<br>
At the moment I'm looking for work as a Junior Software Engineer, open to relocating worldwide.

My of my development experience is primarily with Embedded Software Engineering and secondarily Video Game Development.
I've done performance testing and assurance in my previous position and rapid proto-typing in video game development.

If you're interested in me, I enjoy a variety of different things. At the moment my focus is on fashion and physical fitness. <br>
In the near future I will be painting minitures again and dancing. ðŸ™‚
